## Overview of the Analysis
Investors are interested in expanding the bikshare program CitiBike from NYC to Des Moines, Iowa. Although NYC is very different than Des Moines, performing analyses of the NYC program data may help answer some important questions. 
- What is the customer breakdown of the CitiBike Program? 
- How often are the bikes used and by whom?
- What are the heavy usage commute times?

## Results
- Customer ride count: over 2 million 
- CitiBike users are predominantly male, representing about 65% of the users.
- Checkout Time for Users: The majority of users check out bikes for approximately 20 minutes.
- Checkout times by Gender: Males tend to take longer rides.
- Trips by Weekday per Hour: The heaviest commute time is after work, but users utilize bikes to commute to and from work.
- Trips by Gender: Males are the majority of the bikeshare program users.
- User Trips by Gender by Weekday: Males use the service the most during the weekdays.

## Summary
CitiBike is a remarkably popular mode of transportation in NYC. The customer base is made up mostly of male subscribers, epecially during morning and evening commute times. 

CitiBike may be a good investment in Des Moines if more market research is conducted on female bike riders. It may be worth exploring average trip duration by gender and by birth year, to see if there is a difference between genders as they age.
